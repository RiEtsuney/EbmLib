EbmLib Documentation
===================================
EbmLib is a Python library for working with energy based model, primarily created for my own research needs.

Models
-------------
* Restricted Boltzmann Machines
* Recursive Restriced Boltzmann Machines
* AutoEncoders

Installation
============
installing (you may need sudo)::

    $ python setup.py install

Documentation
=============
You'll need `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ to build documentation.
Sphinx is available from PyPI or if you have easy install::
	
    $ easy_intall -U Sphinx

Once you've obtained Sphinx build html documentation::

	$ cd /path/to/EbmLib/doc/
	$ make html

pdf documentation is not currently working.
